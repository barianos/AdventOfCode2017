# AdventOfCode2017
I stumpled upon the advent of code and found it to be a fun idea.
I also wanted to experiment more with git hub and it seems like a good combo.
I choose C# as a language, since I have only worked withit within Unity, and it would be fun to try other stuff too.
However I do not have much free time right now, don't know if i'll manage to keep going to the end. And I might try different languages on different days, depending on how i feel.
Only time will tell...
