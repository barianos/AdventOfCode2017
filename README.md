# AdventOfCode2017
https://adventofcode.com/
I stumpled upon the advent of code and found it to be a fun idea. Go check it out! :D
I also wanted to experiment more with git hub and it seems like a good combo.
I choose C# as a language, since I have only worked withit within Unity, and it would be fun to try other stuff too. That might change from day to day though, depending on what I feel like coding in each day.
However I do not have much free time right now, don't know if i'll manage to keep going to the end. 
Only time will tell...
